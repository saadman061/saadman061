👋 Hi, I’m Saadman, a Forward Deployed Full-Stack Engineer based in Melbourne 🇦🇺

🚀 I build and ship production-ready web applications end-to-end, working closely with founders and product teams to turn ideas into scalable software.

🛠️ Tech I use daily:
Next.js, React, TypeScript, Python, Node.js, AWS

📦 Experience delivering startup and enterprise products across healthcare, analytics, CRM, and SaaS platforms — from architecture and APIs to deployment and production support.

⚡ Strong bias toward ownership, fast iteration, and real-world impact.

🌱 Currently exploring AI integrations (LLMs, API-driven products) and advanced cloud patterns.
